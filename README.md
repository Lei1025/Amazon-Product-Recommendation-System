# Data Source

[Amazon Review Data (2018)](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)

In my demo, I used `All Beauty - metadata` in Pre-category data, since it is large enough for testing result and also small enough to run fast in my PC.

Ideally, it is in need of `asin`, `price`, `rank`, `review rate`, but review data is in another much larger `review data` file, not given average rate but each rate of every user. Therefore, I just wrote the code cleaning data like below:

![](/assets/uploads/20200418215012.png)

There are multiple way to address data, such as using database(SQL) or filtering in Excel. I wrote a `preProcessMetaFile` method in Recommendation.java to clean my data to a `.csv` file, which is convenient for using `weka` library directly.

## KNN Algorithm
```java
IBk ibk = new IBk();
ibk.getNearestNeighbourSearchAlgorithm().setDistanceFunction(new EuclideanDistance());// Use Euclidean Distance
ibk.setKNN(4);// need X recommendation, result must include itself, so add 1 neighbor
```

`IBK` is "K-nearest neighbours classifier" of weka library.

Compare to [this example](https://towardsdatascience.com/prototyping-a-recommender-system-step-by-step-part-1-knn-item-based-collaborative-filtering-637969614ea), the author mentioned:

> Euclidean distance is unhelpful in high dimensions because all vectors are almost equidistant to the search query vector (target movieâ€™s features). Instead, we will use cosine similarity for nearest neighbor search.

I only have 2 dimensions -- price and rank, at most to add one more --`review`. Therefore `Euclidean Distance` should implement in `KNN`. (It is also the default distance function in  `IBK`, do not need the configuration like I did.)

If given a product's price and rank, KNN will find the K nearest product. For example, K is set to 1, price is 10 and rank is 430,000, it may find the product in row 5 which is the most similar one. By default, IBK class will find the closest one.

In this case, 3 similar items is required and one of them is existing in data file. Thus K value needs to be set to 4, which means exclude the one I selected itself.

# Search

Search function ignores cases and using space can do multiple search keywords like what we familiar with Google.

# GUI

Since search and get recommendation functions take seconds to read original file and download image, performed asynchronous method and proper progress bar animation.
